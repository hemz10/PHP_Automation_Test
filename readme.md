## Test Artifacts

Everytime test(s) are executed using the pytest command, a separate folder bearing a timestamp is created for that test-run inside Report\ directory. All the logs generated during the test-run can be found in this directory.we can also add html report during runtime in the same directory using the command:
``` bash
pytest --html= 'path to report directory'/report.html
```

## Framework Features

* Modular

    * Web Pages have been represented through a Page Object Model (POM).
    * No webdriver api in actual tests. Tests are created by only using aptly named functions. API is restricted to pages and elements classes.
    * Intuitive folder structure that keeps various aspects of the framework organized

* Reporting

    * A separate folder with timestamp is created for each test run containing logs, screenshots and an HTML report.
    * An HTML report can easily be generated that summarises passes, failures, logs, time taken by each test etc.
